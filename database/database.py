# i'm hosting a SQL server on google cloud platform using mySQL
# thus, i need to use mysql.connector as connector for the mySQL server (pyodbc for MS SQL server)

# i initially thought of having a table of user accounts and then a separate table for the list
#  of receipts for each account. this idea is too complicated. instead, it's better to create
#  a table for accounts and then put the transactions of all accounts into the same table and
#  have the accounts as the foreign key

# it's good practice to install a virtual environment (pip install virtualenv)
#  because it makes sense that all the requirements the app needs is contained in
# the project itself so you can transfer the project around and others can just install
# the requirements and use your app

# retarded microsoft again: sometimes, there is erroneous python installed in windows apps. and
#  its path variable goes in front of the python you install on your own. this causes python
#  to not run correctly. to fix this, delete those files (force delete if necessary)
#  also, when you reset environment variables, make sure that you restart CMD otherwise, it
#  won't refresh

# you have to "set FLASK_APP = yourAppName" before you try to run your flask app
# then you just have to python yourAppName.py
